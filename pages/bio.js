        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <h4>1976-82</h4>
        <p>Education: Cambridge University BA MA with a combined degree in Anthropology and Law </p>
        <p>At City University, London, sat for and passed the remaining prerequisites for the English Bar and, thereafter joining Grays Inn (probably the oldest student member of the Inn)</p>
        
        <h4>1982-84</h4>
        <p>Returning to Toronto for two years, having passed the examinations of the Ontario Securities Commission in to practise as a registered stockbroker (with Prudential Bache and Deacon Hodgson).</p>
        
        <h4>1987-93</h4>
        <p>On Wall St, was a very early participant in the emerging Capital Markets related to both interest rate swaps and derivatives and that of loan syndication trading.</p>
        <p>Acted as an intermediary for global bank fulfilling this role at Garvin Guy Butler (ICAP), Noonan Astley Pierce and Fulton Prebon, the three largest global interbank brokers at the time</p>
        
        <h4>1994-2000</h4>
        <p>Driving my interest during this period was the role disruptive technologies played in changing the Banking Industry</p>
        <p>One such company was Vertex where my role was that of director of global sales.</p>
        <p>Vertex developed software able to support both front and back office functionality at a fraction of the cost of a bank’s legacy systems.</p>
        <p>I led presentations for such banks as Swedbank in Sweden.</p>
        <p>I later held a similar position as director of global sales for Intralinks.</p>
        <p>Intralinks was the first to adopt a digital highway as a means of disseminating</p>
        <p>loan agreements electronically, with extensive use of IBM server farms.</p>
        <p>By relying on this digital highway, (well before the widespread use of the internet) access to loan documentation could be established in secure electronic reading rooms, no longer requiring the need for paper transfer.</p>
        <p>I had particular success in sales with the Canadian Banks.</p>
        <p>(John Sculley of Apple fame was on the board) </p>
        <p>Both liquidity and the predictability of default are critical factors in the trading of loans.</p>
        <p>Working with Chase Bank in the early 1990’s the husband and wife team of statisticians</p>
        <p>(Inductive Inference Inc.) made significant inroads into such default predictability with complex algorithms.</p>
        <p>From the late 1980’s I would introduce them to my Bank clients. The relationship</p>
        <p>has endured to the present day.</p>
        <p>The last two years in New York were spent working for Michael Bloomberg  in his Princeton offices. By combining my experience in loan syndications with the Legal education, I developed a effective parsing tool for loans, enabling traders with rapid evaluation.</p>
        
        <h4>2000-present</h4>
        <p>On my return to Toronto I turned back to my academic roots as a researcher, having obtained a place at Trinity Hall Cambridge, with entrance examinations in History.</p>
        <p>I established Alacritas Research mandated to provide independent multi-disciplinary research of the global energy sector. Clients are served by gathering intelligence Allowing for knowledge- based decisions.</p>
        <p>Clients have included Guardian Capital, Sprott, and Roundtable Capital amongst others Subjects researched have included:</p>
        <p>LNG, Peat as Fuel, Technology of Oil Sands Extraction. </p>
        <p>In the Renewable Energy Sector papers on: Thermal Solar, Photovoltaics (solid state lighting) Biomass, Hydrogen fuel cells, Hydrogen to fuel electricity grids, Geothermal and Energy Storage</p>
