        <h2>The Changing Landscape of the Global Energy Sector</h2>
        <p>For most of the past century, geopolitical power was intimately connected to fossil fuels. The fear of an oil embargo or a gas shortage was enough to forge alliances or start wars, and access to oil deposits conferred great wealth. In the world of clean energy, a new set of winners and losers will emerge. Some see it as a clean energy “space race”.</p>
        <p>Countries or regions that master clean technology, export green energy or import less fossil fuel stand to gain from the new system, while those that rely on exporting fossil fuels — such as the Middle East or Russia — could see their power decline.</p>
        <p>The transition will be painful for energy companies that produce oil and gas exclusively.</p>
        <p>In a statement that would have once been unthinkable, BP recently said peak oil may have already occurred in 2019.</p>
        <p>Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, says electricity will become a mainstay of its business.</p>
        <p>“The fundamentals of how we win in power are going to be really different from how you win in resources extraction,” he says. “In oil and gas, you need an asset base. It is about having the best rocks, the lowest cost of production.” </p>
        <p>That equation is turned on its head in the power sector. </p>
        <p>Unlike gas pipelines, electricity trading can go in both directions. Renewable power is also more dispersed, rather than concentrated in a few locations like fossil fuels.  the electricity from one solar farm is just as good as the next. </p>
        <p>Wind, solar, biomass, hydropower, ocean energy, geothermal  are actually available in one form or another in most countries. For places such as Morocco, which imports more than 80 per cent of its energy but also has abundant solar resources, the transition could be an economic gift.</p>
        
        <h3>The Role of Alacritas Research</h3>
        <p>In the race to realize a clean energy world economy by 2050 there will emerge significant innovation and technological change in what could be called the industrial revolution of the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Over this next thirty year period, Alacritas Research will follow these innovations and technological developments with the insights and alliances of many leading scientists around the globe (many of whom already have relationships with the Principal)</p>
        <p>They will serve, in effect, as a revolving advisory board from the leading research Universities in the world (as featured on this website.)</p>
        <p>The role of Alacritas Research will be three fold:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify and validate science claims of companies in the public markets.</li>
          <li>Equally important: Identify and invalidate the false science claims of companies attempting to raise Capital based on these claims.</li>
          <li>Identify and call out the “Snake Oil Factor” present in corporate presentations, whether through intentional misrepresentation or as a form of corporate self deception</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Philosophical Underpinnings of our Research Methodology.</h3>
        <p>A most important distinction is that between the two primary uses of language, the scientific and the emotive.</p>
        <p><i>Scientific language is intrinsically connected with the process of differentiating   between what is true or false.  With emotive language, many arrangements of words evoke attitudes without any reference to truth or falsehood as it matters not at all in such cases whether the emotional references are true or false. </i></p>
        <p>It is precisely the ability to differentiate between these two uses of language, scientific and emotive which is at the root of a science oriented research process. </p>
        
        <h3>Uncovering Snake-oil Science and the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy</h3>
        <p>The language of Snake-oil is deliberately deceptive, dwelling exclusively in the realm of emotion, and particularly suited to subtle persuasion. </p>
        <p>It is a product of a most common human error: the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. </p>
        <p>In this most subtle form of deceptive persuasion, the fact that pain relief follows treatment does not necessarily mean that the treatment caused the pain relief.</p>
        <p>The fallacy lies in coming to a conclusion based <i>solely</i> on the <b>emotions</b> triggered by the order of events, rather than taking into account other factors that might rule out the connection. </p>
        <p>Many superstitious religious beliefs and magical thinking arise from this fallacy, as well as the foundation of many corporate power-point presentations.</p>
        
        <h3>Science as a dynamic dialogue</h3>
        <p>The primary objective when engaging in any research endeavouris to apply principles of reason and rationality, which differentiate itself from simple belief, without eliminating the value of well grounded intuition.</p>
        <p>Scientific methodology however, does not reside in the realm of fixed goalposts.</p>
        <p>Rather, it is a constantly evolving dialogue amongst peers globally, with shifting assumptions based upon new discovery and experiment.</p>
        <p>The greatest respect one can provide a Scientist after publication of a significant paper is to immediately challenge it. This is the process whereby the evolution of Science remains dynamic, rational and free of dogma.</p>
        
        <h3>Abductive Reasoning  The Key to the Analysis of New Ideas</h3>
        <p>“No new idea can be proven deductively or inductively using past data”. <br />Charles Sanders Peirce</p>
        <p>New ideas arise when a thinker observes data that does not fit with existing models<br/>
          The next step to make sense of the observation by making an inference to the best explanation.<br/>
          This form of reasoning is neither deductive nor inductive as it cannot rely on past data.<br/>
          It is a wondering process of what might be a possibility.<br/>
          Pierce named this form of reasoning abductive logic
        </p>
        <p>It is not declarative reasoning with the goal of declaring a conclusion definitively true or false</p>
        <p>Rather it is a reasoning process with the goal to posit what could possibly be true.</p>
        
        <h3>Deduction, induction, abduction</h3>
        <p>Abduction is normally thought of as being one of three major types of inference, the other two being deduction and induction. The distinction between deduction, on the one hand, and induction and abduction, on the other hand, corresponds to the distinction between necessary and non-necessary inferences. In deductive inferences, what is inferred is <i>necessarily</i> true if the premises from which it is inferred are true; that is, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. A familiar type of example is inferences instantiating the schema </p>
        <p>All As are Bs.<br/>
          a is an A.<br/>
          Hence, a is a B.
        </p>
        <p>But not all inferences are of this variety. Consider, for instance, the inference of “John is rich” from “John lives in Chelsea” and “Most people living in Chelsea are rich.” Here, the truth of the first sentence is not guaranteed (but only made likely) by the joint truth of the second and third sentences. Differently put, it is not necessarily the case that if the premises are true, then so is the conclusion: it is logically compatible with the truth of the premises that John is a member of the minority of non-rich inhabitants of Chelsea. The case is similar regarding your inference to the conclusion that Tim and Harry are friends again on the basis of the information that they have been seen jogging together. Perhaps Tim and Harry are former business partners who still had some financial matters to discuss, however much they would have liked to avoid this, and decided to combine this with their daily exercise; this is compatible with their being firmly decided never to make up. </p>
        <p>Since Charles Sanders Peirce, it is standard practice to group non-necessary inferences into <i>inductive</i> and <i>abductive</i> ones</p>

        <p>RELIABILITY </p>
        <p>A RELIABLE PROCESS IS ONE THAT HAS RETURNED</p>
        <p>N NUMBER OF RELIABLE PREDICTIONS N TIMES IN THE PAST WHERE N IS A LARGE NUMBER.</p>
        <p>IT IS RELIABLE BECAUSE THE PROCESS THAT GENERATED IT HAS WORKED IN THE PAST. RELIABILITY IS ACHIEVED BY NARROWING THE SCOPE OF A TEST MODEL TO WHAT CAN BE MEASURED IN A REPLICABLE QUANTITATIVE WAY AND BY ELIMINATING AS MUCH SUBJECTIVITY AND NUANCE AS POSSIBLE</p>
        <p>VALIDITY.</p>
        <p>A VALID PREDICTIVE MODEL IS FUTURE ORIENTED AND BASED ON WHAT IF SCENARIOs. THE GOAL OF VALIDITY IS TO PRODUCE OUTCOMES THAT MEET A DESIRED OBJECTIVE.</p>
        <p>Supposing such and such were fact what could be inferred? </p>
        <p>VALIDITY IS NOT BASED ON QUANTITATIVE MEASURED DATA FROM THE PAST ALONE (THE ROOT OF A RELIABLE PREDICTION). NUANCE AND SUBJECTIVITY ARE INCORPORATED IN THE MODEL</p>
        <p>A VALID PREDICTION. CANNOT BE JUDGED VALID BEFORE THE FUTURE EVENT ABOUT WHICH IT IS PREDICATED ACTUALLY HAPPENS.</p>
        <p>PAST PREDICTIVE SUCCESS IS TREATED AS HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED AGAINST FUTURE OBSERVATION.</p>
        <p>A VALID SYSTEM PRODUCES RESULTS THAT ARE SHOWN THROUGH THE PAGGAGE OF TIME TO BE CORRECT</p>
        <p>THE INDUCTIVE FALLACY IS THAT OF INFERRING VALIDITY FROM RELIABILITY. IN ITS MOST PERNICIOUS FORM STATING THAT THE RELIABILITY OF A PREDICTION LOGICALLY ENTAILS ITS VALIDITY</p>
